Not everyone is a fan of mass marketing. Customers have somewhat developed a dislike for mass marketing emails. 
For instance, emails which are too generic or do not really connect with them. Customers feel more impressed and attached to a brand which interacts with them personally.
Gaining marketing benefits with personalised emails is however a challenge. This challenge led us to explore the world of Email Signatures.
Email signatures have been by far the most under-rated and ignored asset of an email. 
This article hopes to explain the importance of Email Signatures and how they can be used as an effective channel for marketing.

## Importance of Email Signatures

Email Signatures are very useful and an effective means of marketing channel. 
A marketing channel you already own. They have existed for centuries now, if they weren’t useful it would not exist, right? Remember Orkut? Yes, Google shut it down.
Email Signatures exist because emails do.

No matter how many social media platforms are created, Email will always remain the base foundation for every marketing campaign. 
This is because Emails are the most reliable and preferred channel for business communications.
It is estimated that over 269 billion emails are sent and received each day.
In their Email Statistics Report, Radicati says:

In another study done by Sigstr, where they conducted eye-tracking analysis and tests around dozens of different email signature examples, they found out that emails with branded signatures ( and a call to action) generated significant traction and recipient engagement with the signature area was high.
Email Signatures are here to stay as long as email does.
